    The game of Tic Tac Toe, also known as Three in a Row, is played between
    two players, "X" and "O", who take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid.

    The player who manages to place three of their marks in a horizontal,
    vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

    You can play this game locally, with a family member or friend.
